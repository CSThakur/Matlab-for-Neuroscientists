%For I=-0.2
%Notice that the voltage does return to the equilibrium value of 1.1994
%Also notice that it returns by first decreasing below the equilibrium
%value, then increasing above the equilibrium value, and then finally
%approaching the equilibrium value as t goes beyond 10. This is an example
%of damped oscillations. The neuron's membrane voltage is oscillating
%(above and below the equilibrium value), but as time passes the amplitude
%of the oscillation diminishes and the membrane potential approaches its
%resting potential. This is the hallmark of subthreshold oscillations.

%For I=-0.4
%The neuron receives a suprathreshold stimulus and begins to spike.
%Notice now that the system is following a limit cycle and the neuron's
%membrane potential is periodic. The resting potential is no longer a stable
%point in the dynamics. Instead, the neuron begins to fire spikes at a rate
%of around 6 Hz.

%For I=-1.6
%Now the neuron only fires 1 spike before returning to its resting membrane
%potential. This phenomenon is observed in real neurons where increased
%current injection can repress continuous firing. This is known as
%excitation block.
